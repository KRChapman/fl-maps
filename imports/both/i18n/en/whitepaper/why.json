It has borrowed from its children's wealth, creating nations where entire generations are largely unable to own a home. It has created a work/life balance where people are living under so much pressure that they push back basic human norms, like starting a family, because it's too expensive",

Rapidly growing the community through an incentivised ecosystem, directing energy into finding more effective ways to achieve positive societal and cultural change, ideas that we can’t even imagine yet – but can’t wait to see!"

Where creative ideas and solutions could emerge freely, gaining traction on their own merit, and grow into large scale social events and projects. Then, gradually, they took this tool away. Making it ever more difficult for those ideas to reach an audience unless there was money behind them. Business, celebrity and big charities began dominating reach in a 'pay to play' system. Led by Facebook a ‘click and move-on’ culture was designed. Educating much of the world's population to ever-shorter attention spans, as faster clicks equals more ad revenue. Grass-roots change creators struggled to engage the communities they had built. Then Facebook, and others, began listening to our conversations online, and offline. Collecting our location data. Extrapolating and creating immense data sets of our most personal information to sell to the highest bidder. They used this to facilitate election hacking, undermining our democracies",

It brings back the ability for social movements to form freely around innovative ideas for change. It pushes back against this exploitive consumer culture, re-educating users to slow down and become active participants in the projects and activities they want to support. Empowering us all to realise the incredible power we all possess when uniting in mass around creative ideas for positive change. Our platform is 100% open source and will never sell users valuable personal data"

Yet individually it's leaders are mobilising millions of people each year into action to meet society's need for increasing peace, community and human connection, understanding, kindness, and well-being. None of those things are recognised, or measured todays GDP based societies; and so it goes under the radar. It's leaders living in poverty in order to try and meet society's unmet needs - it's rising stars are often faced with a choice of eating or quitting.

That certain Cryptocurrencies use more energy in mining than entire medium sized nations, is perhaps the biggest issue the industry faces.
