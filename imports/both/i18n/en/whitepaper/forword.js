This whitepaper is open to everyone’s ideas. Please contribute to its evolution by clicking on the balloons and adding your thoughts and experience on how each section of our plan can better transform human society into one focused on improving well-being for people, societies and our planet.

&nbsp;

**Foreword:**
We are Tokenising Happiness to bring more peace and well-being into the World. 

Since 2012 we’ve been a global community of volunteers, our mission: to build positive projects and get people into the streets tackling societal issues where they live using creative and positive ideas. Our actions are both local and global in scale, but always led by local people so as to empower communities to create change themselves. We call this 'Local Action for Global Change'. 

Today’s economic system is broken. This whitepaper sets out our vision to transition our community to an incentivised ecosystem and invite other groups to join it as an effort to rebalance it by creating an entirely new economic system.

GDP based economic systems were designed by Simon Kuznets, in 1937 as a temporary post war recovery system, but the beast got out of control. The damage caused to humanity by basing our decision making processes on measurements of GDP isn’t even contentious any more. [Here’s a list](https://news.focallocal.org/beyond-gdp-key-quotes-from-economic-and-world-leaders/) of global and economic leaders stating the need to move past it.

&nbsp;

**Most Charities, and volunteering shouldn’t exist**

Sectors like Industry, Tech, Finance have lots of money behind them. Others like Education, Healthcare, Environment, by Kuznets design, have less. Other areas which are also essential to producing healthy, happy societies, have no value placed on them at all within a GDP based economy, leaving them for social enterprises, or charities who most spending a significant percent of their energy and time chasing, or begging for funding. Or for the kind hearted members of our society to volunteer to meet them. 

This system is inefficient and unfair, yet we’ve come to accept it as the norm. If you benefit society you should be rewarded for it. That is what economic systems were designed for.

Crypto-economics gives humanity, all of us, the ability to design new economic systems. No-longer are we locked into today’s (Fiat) currencies and GDP based value and reward systems/metrics which are perpetuating this unbalanced and unfair society. 

This token creates a new economic system. One which focuses energy onto these essential societal areas which are currently overlooked and ignored in today's GDP based economies. Refocusing our energy on how best we can increase the well-being of people, societies, and out planet - rather than how best to earn profit. 


&nbsp;

The Public Happiness Platform is designed around two core functions:

&nbsp;

**1. Public Happiness Gatherings**

Our platform allows positive people to find positive ideas to create social impact, and gather with others nearby who want to join them bringing that impact to their local community.

Ourselves and our Public Happiness partners currently engage more than a million people on the streets all around the world every year in activities designed to that bring more peace and well-being to where they live. Our token will incentivise that behaviour allowing it to scale exponentially. We give an economic reward to those using positive projects and activities to target societal issues including: 

* community and human connection
* homelessness
* isolation
* crime rates
* anti social behaviour
* lack of opportunities to engage in music/art/performance
* creative environmental action

We can use these activities to take blockchain to the streets and engage the public in a way never done before, to teach the basics and demonstrate how this new tech can be used to directly impact their lives.

&nbsp;

**2. Public Happiness Projects**

Our platform operates a Microvolunteering Platform to build global projects which empower local people to create positive change where they live. 

In a GDP based system a great idea for positive change relies on the person who has it to have the skills, connections, ability, and often finances to deliver it. In our platform the most effective ideas, which can be recreated by local people anywhere, are suggested and voted on. Then community comes together to build the best ones in our [Building Section](https://publichappinessmovement.com/docuss/build). Offering a new route for creative sparks to build a brighter future to be delivered, which otherwise are often lost.

For example; [The Brighter Tomorrow Map](https://brightertomorrowmap.com). 

An effort to empower local people to support those who are homeless nearby. Built with no-funding needed, just kindness. Tokenising this existing process we've been using will massively increase the capacity and velocity of amazing projects built to benefit humanity and society, giving humanity new tools to achieve positive change. 

&nbsp;

**Impact**

If the right people get behind this it will have a profound effect on increasing peace, happiness, and reducing human-suffering across the world. You are welcome to join us if you have skills to contribute, and a passion to create positive change for humanity.

*'Those who love peace must learn to organize as effectively as those who love war'*  - Martin Luther King

Our new platform is open to all groups operating in a non-profit way towards similar aims - or those who want to explore switching to an economic model which rewards them. Today many.. In fact most, of the leaders and stars of this neglected economic sector end up leaving it due to the impoverishing nature of working in an economic sector where there are no financial rewards.

Our platform provides a space for these existing Public Happiness networks to escape the ‘pay to play’ culture social media has shifted towards, and unite - growing into something far larger than the sum of their parts, while retaining their unique and individual natures. Combining will multiply exponentially their efforts, unleashing an unstoppable worldwide Movement for a world with more community connection, happiness and well-being. We’ve reached the point where this platform is ready (although not currently optimised) to begin hosting communities who will become owners of their new home, contributing to its governance and evolution. 

Note: This white paper is quite long. The most effective way to contribute is by reading the [intro](https://publichappinessmovement.com/docuss/wp_intro) and [why](https://publichappinessmovement.com/docuss/wp_why) ‘the world needs this’, and then clicking the sections in the contents page which you’d most like to contribute to.
