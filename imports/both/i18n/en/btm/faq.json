Why not arrange an old phone donation locally and give-away at local shelters. You could even arrange with local cafes to allow people who are homeless to drop them off for charging when needed"

      "heading" : "How do you protect vulnerable people from people using the site to exploit them?",
      "text" : "Much like a site offering ride sharing, or couch surfing, users give feedback on the experience they had interacting with other users. Someone feeling vulnerable can/should choose to interact with the many users who’ve already earned trust within the community. We recommend posting public meeting places, especially for newer users. Experienced and trusted members are invited to become Community Leaders who are available to offer guidance, and to encourage the growth of an aware and close-knit local community who will quickly spot anything that looks out of the ordinary and bring it to the attention of everyone"

      "text" : "We are absolutely not selling your data to anyone, ever! The Brighter Tomorrow Map was built by The Focallocal Public Happiness Community by people just coming together to create positive change in society. There are no wages to pay and very few outgoings. Founder Andy has financially supported all Public Happiness projects himself since 2012, which he affords by living in a van and spending money earned freelancing on projects to bring more peace and well-being into the world. We try to get most things, like hosting, free from companies corporate social responsibility. Recently as we grew and costs went up, a few community members have also begun chipping in to share the costs around"
